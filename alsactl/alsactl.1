.SH NAME
alsactl \- advanced controls for ALSA soundcard driver

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBalsactl\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIstore\fP|\fIrestore\fP|\fIinit\fP] <card # or id or device>

\fBalsactl\fP \fImonitor\fP <card # or id>

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBalsactl\fP is used to control advanced settings for the ALSA
soundcard drivers. It supports multiple soundcards. If your card has
features that you can't seem to control from a mixer application,
you have come to the right place.

.SH COMMANDS

\fIstore\fP saves the current driver state for the selected soundcard
to the configuration file.

\fIrestore\fP loads driver state for the selected soundcard from the
configuration file. If restoring fails (eventually partly), the init
action is called.

\fInrestore\fP is like \fIrestore\fP, but it notifies also the daemon
to do new rescan for available soundcards.

\fIinit\fP tries to initialize all devices to a default state. If device
is not known, error code 99 is returned.

\fIdaemon\fP manages to save periodically the sound state.

\fIrdaemon\fP like \fIdaemon\fP but restore the sound state at first.

\fIkill\fP notifies the daemon to do the specified operation (quit,
rescan, save_and_quit).

\fImonitor\fP is for monitoring the events received from the given
control device.

\fIclean\fP clean the controls created by applications.

If no soundcards are specified, setup for all cards will be saved,
loaded or monitored.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fI\-h, \-\-help\fP 
Help: show available flags and commands.

.TP
\fI\-d, \-\-debug\fP
Use debug mode: a bit more verbose.

.TP
\fI\-v, \-\-version\fP
Print alsactl version number.

.TP
\fI\-f, \-\-file\fP
Select the configuration file to use. The default is /var/lib/alsa/asound.state.

.TP
\fI\-l, \-\-lock\fP
Use the file locking to serialize the concurrent access to the state file (this
option is default for the global state file).

.TP
\fI\-L, \-\-no-lock\fP
Do not use the file locking to serialize the concurrent access to the state
file (including the global state file).

.TP
\fI\-O, \-\-lock-state-file\fP
Select the state lock file path.

.TP
\fI\-F, \-\-force\fP
Used with restore command.  Try to restore the matching control elements
as much as possible.  This option is set as default now.

.TP
\fI\-g, \-\-ignore\fP
Used with store, restore and init commands. Do not show 'No soundcards found'
and do not set an error exit code when soundcards are not installed.

.TP
\fI\-P, \-\-pedantic\fP
Used with restore command.  Don't restore mismatching control elements.
This option was the old default behavior.

.TP
\fI\-I, \-\-no\-init\-fallback\fP
Don't initialize cards if restore fails.  Since version 1.0.18,
\fBalsactl\fP tries to initialize the card with the restore operation
as default.  But this can cause incompatibility with the older version.
The caller may expect that the state won't be touched if no state file
exists.  This option takes the restore behavior back to the older
version by suppressing the initialization.

.TP
\fI\-r, \-\-runstate\fP
Save restore and init state to this file. The file will contain only errors.
Errors are appended with the soundcard id to the end of file.

.TP
\fI\-R, \-\-remove\fP
Remove runstate file at first.

.TP
\fI\-E, \-\-env\fP #=#
Set environment variable (useful for init action or you may override
ALSA_CONFIG_PATH to read different or optimized configuration - may be
useful for "boot" scripts).

.TP
\fI\-i, \-\-initfile\fP
The configuration file for init. By default, PREFIX/share/alsa/init/00main
is used.

.TP
\fI\-p, \-\-period\fP
The store period in seconds for the daemon command.

.TP
\fI\-e, \-\-pid-file\fP
The pathname to store the process-id file in the HDB UUCP format (ASCII).

.TP
\fI\-b, \-\-background\fP
Run the task in background.

.TP
\fI\-s, \-\-syslog\fP
Use syslog for messages.

.TP
\fI\-n, \-\-nice\fP
Set the process priority (see 'man nice')

.TP
\fI\-c, \-\-sched-idle\fP
Set the process scheduling policy to idle (SCHED_IDLE).

.TP
\fI\-D, \-\-ucm-defaults\fP
Execute also the 'defaults' section from the UCM configuration. The standard
behaviour is to execute only 'once' section.

.TP
\fI\-U, \-\-no-ucm\fP
Skip the UCM init even if available. It may be useful for the test the
legacy init configuration.

.SH FILES
\fI/var/lib/alsa/asound.state\fP (or whatever file you specify with the
\fB\-f\fP flag) is used to store current settings for your
soundcards. The settings include all the usual soundcard mixer
settings.  More importantly, alsactl is
capable of controlling other card-specific features that mixer apps
usually don't know about.

The configuration file is generated automatically by running
\fBalsactl store\fP. Editing the configuration file by hand may be
necessary for some soundcard features (e.g. enabling/disabling
automatic mic gain, digital output, joystick/game ports, some future MIDI
routing options, etc).
